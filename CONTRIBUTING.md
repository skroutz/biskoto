# Contributing

If you discover issues, have ideas for improvements or new features,
please report them to the [issue tracker][1] of the repository or
submit a pull request. Please, try to follow these guidelines when you
do so.

## Issue reporting

* Check that the issue has not already been reported.
* Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code
  (a.k.a. `master`).
* Be clear, concise and precise in your description of the problem.
* Open an issue with a descriptive title and a summary in grammatically correct,
  complete sentences.
* Mention the version of the package you are using.
* Include any relevant code to the issue summary.

## Pull requests

* Read [how to properly contribute to open source projects on Github][2].
* Fork the project.
* Use a topic/feature branch to easily amend a pull request later, if necessary.
* Comply with our [git style guide][3].
* Use the same coding conventions as the rest of the project.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it
  in a future version unintentionally.
* [Squash related commits together][5].
* Open a [pull request][4] that relates to *only* one subject with a clear title
  and description in grammatically correct, complete sentences.
